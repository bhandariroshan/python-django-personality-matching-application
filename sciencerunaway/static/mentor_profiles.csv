It's nice to have a mixture of teaching, research and a lot of meetings- to get the things we need!","I love interacting with patients and getting to know them personally and figuring out what makes them tick!  I love being part of such a rich teamwork setting- patients get really good care and we have everyone from a pharmacist, dietician, PT etc working together.  I have only been at Stanford two years- to build and test out this model of a clinic for a high cost high risk population.",For 28 years I was a family practitioner in a small town in Northern California- running a business and giving good care is a challenge.  Then I was a county health official and that's challenging because of the responsibility of the population's health and then the politics involved.  Leaving all that and joining Stanford was a huge challenge.

I teach at a medical school, so somedays I teach, somedays I operate, somedays I am in an admin role as the head of the transplant center.  I have two kids, so I am a mom, and I'm also a wife.  Every day is gift and some days are fabulous, a few can be a lump of coal, but the differences make it all so much fun.","Being a transplant surgeon, I get to help people have a new life.  With one operation, I get to change their lives.  Helping people find meaning through a donation is also very rewarding- we can offer comfort that even in death your loved one can still help someone else!  It's a big job, there's a lot to it, and you do have to make choices.  Even if I could make different choices, I would still make the same choices- because it is always worth it.  Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.  It's rare and wonderful to be able to offer respite from misery to people, and I love that.","One of the things I struggle with all the time is balance.  Where do I want to be in 25 years?  I'm very dedicated to my family and kids, and I constantly want to make sure that I can be there for my family!  I worry that it might be easier for my kids if I could be at home all the time, but at the same time, it's something I need for me.  The balance between personal and professional and the expectations I have for myself and the people around me.  I hate to feel like I am letting anyone down.","There's always new discoveries and new medications that come on board that help transplants last longer, medications with fewer side effects.

It's all about ensuring that every student has a successful time and can move on well to the next step.  For medical school, that's the residency.  So we teach our students critical thinking and communications skills.","I always wanted to be a doctor, since I was seven!  After I went through medical school, I had a really rough time in medical school because it was very de-humanizing, and several years out, I knew I wanted to help make medical schools better, especially for women.  I really love my job because I feel like I get to make a difference.","Training as a physician is incredibly challenging- mentally, physically and emotionally.  However, you are still surrounded generally by mentors and friends who want to see you succeed.  As I began my career in academic medicine- where I was a doctor and teaching future doctors- I saw that there were special challenges for women in academic medicine.  I got married and raised a family- and it's doable, but it has it's own fun challenges and is very important.",We are getting better at medicine at getting what we know to people who need it- solving the disparities in healthcare.  We have known some cheap and easy interventions- but there are still parts of the population that don't get them.  Fixing our system so everyone has opportunities to access them is very exciting.    I''m also excited about the genomics revolution and hope we can see genetic diseases eradicated.,"I grew up in Clear Lake Texas, halfway between Houston and Galveston- where the Space Center is!  My mom is a teacher, and my dad works for IBM where he programmed for Apollo!","My favorite teacher was my high school basketball coach!

I need to find that peace to restore and refresh myself.  If you lead a hectic, busy life, you need that so you can still have more to give.","Our medical students!  Many of them at AUC come from difficult backgrounds, and their stories are so incredible.

This is what I have wanted to do for a long time, and I am enjoying it right now.  On the horizon, I would like to have a higher level of involvement in health education policies globally.  Right now, I'm having a lot of fun doing this!"Joanna Kelly,I am a professor at Washington State University every day my duties changed on a typical day. I am probably working on two different projects within the laboratory. A lot of what I do is computational so I'm at the computer and I also teach here. I teach Gino science as well as contemporary genetics. Each semester I teach one class. I have my graduate degree and PhD degree in genome sciences. All of the research projects in my lab are around genetics and genomics.,I love genetics and genomics and science more generally because I am able to have a lot of different questions and try to answer them. For me doing research is really exciting. I love it because I'm always exploring new ideas and reading new things. I'm often reading journal articles and popular science articles to try and inform my own research on the latest and most pristine research.,"There had definitely been some moments challenge in my career. I actually started in college as a mathematics major. I love mathematics through elementary school, grade school, high school, all throughout. In my upbringing I was really interested in math  and thenI got to college and I wasn't sure if math was the right thing for me. That was a really big challenge to have thought. I love math all through my upbringing and then gotten to the point where oh oh I thought maybe this isn't the right thing to do. That was a big challenge. Those moments thinking what classes to take, what steps to take, what track to take, were definitely a challenge but very exciting.","The latest innovations that are particularly close to me are, this year they discovered the thousand dollar genome. Which is something that when I started graduate school, a number of years ago, never even existed; it was almost science-fiction. And now we can genetically sequence the human genome with $1000 and that cost the next few years will go down. For me this innovation really open doors for the way that we can look at human genetic data as well as other species. The fact that we can sequence human genome gives us hope to sequence other species at low-cost to really get deep insight into the biological processes. What's really exciting personally is ability to sequence ancient genomes. And that were seen many different articles, there was one earlier last week, about the frequency of different ancient genomes. It's really transforming the way that we think about genetics and DNA. It's amazing! So one of my big projects for the PhD was looking at a specific thing that exists in tooth enamel formation. I spent a lot of time sequencing this gene, spend a lot of time in the lab, now the project can be done in less than a week. This proves how fast of a pace at which were at now. All these ideas are really revolutionizing genomics.","I grew up in Santa Cruz California is. It was wonderful. I currently live in Pullman Washington and it's snowing outside right now. I can contrast that to sunny California and going to high school 10 minutes from the beach. It was great; the community in Santa Cruz is incredibly supportive and fun loving. We were always outside, and I think that really improve my love of science, biology, and math, just the exposure playing in the woods, in the dirt, and constantly exploring.","One teacher that really had an influence on me was in high school she was actually the leadership teacher as well as taught a leadership class. She really supported my leadership development and my ability to be involved in high school. It doesn't directly relate to science it was related to my development as a leader, my learning skills about how to learn and organize people. Definitely put me at an advantage although it's a small scale thing. This is one way for me to start as leader and make changes. Also when I was a graduate student there was a teacher, she was on my PhD committee. Her influence on my career, has been just incredible. She has been incredibly supportive, and making sure that I am aware of and taking advantage of all the opportunities and help regarding my research and then pointing me towards people with similar interests. To this day she influences the supports my research. I feel very fortunate to have her as a supporter and a mentor.","Throughout a research career from college to graduate school, at these biological sciences, you do a postdoc which is a postdoctoral training period. Which is equivalent to a residency for a doctor. I personally became professor here at WSU and it's been very interesting adapting and learning the new ways to run a lab. This is very different than being a part of somebody else's research program. It's become a bit apparent to me that it's kind of like running a small business. You have to learn how to manage money, and manage people, hire people, and train people while at the same time meeting with other people to make sure the department is meeting the contract. It's not a specific interest where I need to change my approach but really just learning a whole new skill set for the job. It has been exciting, challenging, and interesting.","One of my unique attributes is my enthusiasm. I am very excited about what I do, and it becomes very clear to anyone who works with me, which has left to a lot of great collaborations and exciting discussions in science. I hope that it is kind of contagious, and I have felt this through the conversations where people become excited with the work that I am doing.",,"My all time favorite nook is called the Rain of Gold by Victor Villasenor. Its a novel thats written about his parents, and their immigration from Mexico to the US. It is a really beautiful novel about these two families and their challenges with coming across the border. Both of them I believe undocumented and building their lives in the US and how they meet, and how their lives become intertwined. I read it in middle school originally, and Ive read it multiple times, until then; I highly recommend it.","For work, one of my favorite websites is twitter. Many people not not think about Twitter as a good resources for work but the scientific community that I am involved in has some pretty active posters and their constantly contributing ideas and thoughts and posting about new papers. For me its great to follow twitter and what is trending on a daily or weekly basis in science. That is a website that I use frequently to follow trends in genetics and populations genetics. For fun, prior to living in Pullman when I actually lived closer to the eater I actually raced sailboats. So i started racing sailboats when I was a graduate student in Seattle and I have love to be in the water racing ever since, very competitive since then. Now that I moved to pullman and their isn¡¯t a big body of water I have been more time hiking and being outdoors but not on the water.","My biggest inspiration has been my parents, and probably my mother. She has a PhD in biology and recieved it when very few woman had a PhD in science. She has been continuously supporting, and pushing my siblings and me to accomplish whatever we can and always challenged to do the best that we possibly could.","Whats next is to build a research gram here at WashU. So as we talked about I am kind of new, but My biggest inspiration has been my parents, and probably my mother. She has a PhD in biology and received it when very few woman had a PhD in science.

We have a very distributed team- people work in different parts of the globe, different time zones and so it's a much more flexible working environment.","One of the greatest things about the work we do is that we want to democratize the space around brain research.  We have the opportunity to transform lives in a significant way- and this mission really resonates with our team.  As a result, the team finds it easier to live a meaningful life!","A lot of us spent much of our life finding what we are passionate about- and I was just like that.  I wanted to find something that would captivate my heart and imagination.  I was always very reflective, and so I really wanted to find that.  As a teenager, I did community service to help people find vocational work and education that would help people find a job.  It mattered to me that I was trying to do something positive.  I started my career in law, at a large law firm in Australia.  As I was working there, we started a section of the firm that serviced innovators and entrepreneurs- as I moved over and became more and more interested, I found that the digital revolution and information age was transformative and I wanted to be a part of the action.  And that's when I made the change!  It has to be the unique fuse of inspiration, ideas, and the right mix of people- and when I ran into the brain area, I was completely crazy over it.

It was an honest mistake, but still wrong.  I spent days worrying about it, not sleeping, imagining how I would lose my job once my boss found out.   I finally told him and, to my surprise, he asked me a bunch of questions to understand where I went wrong, and then we built a plan together to fix the mistake.  I was lucky he was understanding.  It taught me that when I make a mistake, I need to quickly take responsibility for it and then share it with someone who can help find a solution.  There are very few problems without a solution.  There is always a path forward.  My biggest challenge was working with someone I didn¡¯t trust.  It took so much energy to get anything done because I was always checking if that person did what they said they would do and trying to figure out what else they were doing, and not telling me.

At that very moment, my dissertation chair happened to walk out of the class room to get something from his office and saw me.  I explained what had just happened and he arranged for me to have another 24 hours with the registrar to make changes.  I went back to the latest version that I had on a separate disk and got the job done.      Life lesson:  Never panic _ everything is manageable.  That experience guides my reaction, even now, in crisis management.","I am most excited about the breakthrough in Genomics and the potential of innovation in targeted (or tailored or personalized) medicine.  The breakthroughs in understanding the DNA structure of all living things (and particularly in the human race) enables us to better understand the cycle or pattern of diseases and develop therapies that target them , while limited side effect profiles.   This is coupled with the explosion in technology and the use of automated systems to replicate and analyze information much faster than ever imagined is simply amazing. This innovation and the application of it in increasingly precise ways is revolutionary.",I grew up in Northeast Washington DC.,"My favorite school teacher is my mother, who was my first teacher of life, information and culture.  She established in me the seeds to understanding that ¡°nothing is impossible _ so go ahead and soar!¡± She was not only a phenomenal role-model but taught business in the DC school system for 46 years.   Aside from my Mom, Mr. Greene was my favorite teacher who taught me in the 7th grade. She helped me to make a good transition into junior high school and was a gentle _ yet firm disciplinarian.  I was able to go to Europe under her watch and she nurtured experiences/exposures outside of America.  My exposure to the world and global possibilities was birthed.","I moved from NJ to Indianapolis in 2004 to take a new job.  I had no family or friends there, but wanted to use this as an opportunity to adapt my social and professional style to successfully live in the Midwest.  Nearly everything was different _ even the rate of speech. Nevertheless, this was an opportunity for me to understand my new environment, listen to people and drop my perceptions of ¡°what is normal¡± so as to be more open to change. This required me to look at things from the eyes or others but also be comfortable in bringing ¡°my authentic¡± self to the table _ and that be okay.","My talent is in synthesizing complexity.  I am not sure how unique it is. However, I have a gift of being able to digest complex concepts (or things that don¡¯t seem to go together) and develop patterns or develop a strategy from diverse parts.  These connections just seem to flow together. I then use the synthesized concepts to dialogue and engage with others.  This stimulates conversations and great collaborations.","Personal style _ custom, monogrammed French cuff shirts with cufflinks.

Understanding His walk and impact on people is a constant source of inspiration and way to model my life.  I am not nearly as perfect as He is; but I try to think about love, compassion and grace the way that He did.","What is next for me is to continue to work to bring solutions through innovation.  As Sanofi continues to evolve in the constantly changing healthcare eco-system, I hope that I can play a part in that transformation.  In particular, I would like to contribute to the understanding of how diverse patient populations and communities can contribute to this evolution with industry or pharmaceutical sponsors.  We are currently engaged in building research structures and platforms that enable us to be more patient-centered.  A key part of this is having Participatory Action Research and Engagement opportunities that help us to be better partners in healthcare solutions. I would also hope to be an inspiration to the next four generations of scientists.  An impactful woman leaves an inheritance to the next few generations."Kristine Bordenave,"I look at healthcare delivery and healthcare delivery organization, how we can assess, evaluate and help with those efforts.  I want to be a part of improving outcomes for patient populations.","I love it because it truly makes a difference.  I feel like I make the world a better place every day through the work I do.  It's rewarding because it is impactful, but also because it's really interesting and keeps me learning every day.

Recently, I have been able to learn about legal and regulatory work in healthcare- which is new, and fun to learn.","The biggest fear- am I capable of doing this? Overcoming that self doubt is a constant challenge- balancing my personal and academic life.  There were two strategies I used- the first, just to do it.  By doing it, I would be able to do it, and I would be comfortable doing more.  You can't decide anything is or isn't until you try it!  You have to step out on faith and try.","Healthcare information exchange.  The exchange of information is so exciting to me because so much of what we see in healthcare (negative financial and healthcare consequences) is because of people lacking the right information at the right time.  Also, genetics because it is just so cool!  The more we understand how genetics participates in disease causation, the more we can do to put the pieces together.","I grew up in the South Valley of Albuquerque- a rural, some might say impoverished, area.  It was very traditional in terms of gender roles, but also open to the idea of the individual.  There was a huge ability to learn whatever you wanted and a strong sense of cultural celebration.  There was every nationality represented- and every socioeconomic status- in the community.  There was a sense of equality and community regardless of background.  It was a very cool place to grow up in!",PASS,PASS,"I can wrinkle my face like a rabbit!

She's a brilliant, thoughtful individual  and balances that out with her kindness which makes such a difference to everyone around her and her patients.",I would like to expand my understanding of the law and federal regulation with respect to healthcare delivery.
