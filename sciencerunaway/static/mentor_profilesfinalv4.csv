In 1984, working together with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, she discovered telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomeres, or chromosome ends.  In 1988, Dr. Greider went to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where, as an independent Cold Spring Harbor Fellow, she cloned and characterized the RNA component of telomerase.  In 1990, Dr. Greider was appointed as an assistant investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, followed later by appointment to Investigator in 1994. She expanded the focus of her telomere research to include the role of telomere length in cellular senescence, cell death and in cancer.  In 1997, Dr. Greider moved her laboratory to the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  In 2003 she was appointed as the Daniel Nathans Professor and Director of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics.  At Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Greider 's group continued to study the biochemistry of telomerase and determined the secondary structure of the human telomerase RNA. She also expanded her work to include a mouse model of dyskeratosis congenita and stem cell failure in response to short telomeres. Dr. Greider shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009 with Drs. Elizabeth Blackburn and Jack Szostak for their work on telomeres and telomerase. Dr. Greider currently directs a group of 10 scientists studying both the role of short telomeres in age-related disease and cancer as well as the regulatory mechanism that maintain telomere length.","Days in my life are extremely varied.  I don't have a regular day- which is nice.  I will meet one on one with the researchers working in my lab and get all the nitty gritty experiment details- maybe six or seven meetings in a day, maybe once or twice a week.  I teach large lecture classes as well as small groups.  I spend time in administrative meetings- hiring and promotional meetings.  The thing I love the best is meeting one on one with scientists- or our meetings where one scientist presents their work and we all brainstorm- or our meetings based on scientific literature where we critique current articles and really learn from other's work.","There are surprising things that you learn- even little small things.  I like finding things out.  Even when you get a small thing to work, it's very satisfying!  And the big things, like RNAi for biology, that when I was a graduate student we didn't know anything about.  That's why I will be reading Science and Nature when I get home, on a Friday night.  I try to read biology generally, not just my specific field.","One of the things I believe about science- the difference between science and politics is that in science you can always get something right- in politics you never can!  I have always prided myself on being clear that we set out to test a hypothesis, not prove a hypothesis- but I also pride myself on being correct!  There are times when we have published things that scientifically were wrong- but I felt very strongly that we had to publish the results that showed we were wrong too.  If I believe science is self correcting, it is my duty to correct myself.  There's pressure to spin things- but science doesn't move forward that way.",Advances in genome sequencing- and what we can discover with the ease of genome sequencing today.

The fundamental insights of cell-matrix interactions are applied towards stem cell-based therapies with respect to improving cell survival and regenerative capacity, as well as engineered vascularized tissues for therapeutic implantation. Current projects focus on the role of naturally-derived ECMs to enhance endothelial differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells on two-dimensional ECM microarrays of varying substrate rigidity. The knowledge gained from understanding cell-ECM interactions are applied towards engineering prevascularized skeletal or cardiac muscle constructs using nanotopographical cues derived from nanofibrillar ECMs.","I do a lot of exciting research to explore new areas. To do that, I have to put ideas into grant proposals and seek out potential funding.  Another aspect of my day is mentoring post-doctoral fellows, medical students, and research assistants. I help groom the next generation of researchers.","I love exploring the unknown and finding new ways to improve health. And with mentorship, I very much like that I am giving back to society, as well, paying forward to thank those who have inspired me in my field.","The fear I recall most is living up to educational standards. In society, we expect students to go to school, to college, and it seems like a very long path. When we are young, we see no option. For me, my perseverance paid off.As far as challenges go, I 've always been self-motivated. I knew that as long as I worked hard enough, anything is possible.  So, as I was growing up I took on more challenges, such as harder classes, or new extra-curricular activities.","I am most excited about tissue engineering that is, growing artificial tissues and organs to replace diseased areas. Creating an organ: that 's as exciting as it gets! We need to understand not only the science but also the engineering of the human body and the function of a normal organ.  This is very complex. Think about it, a heart is a complex organ with an intricate and integral function for life. Creating a heart is not easy, but with the expertise we have already working on tissue engineering, I am confident that we may have engineered organs in 30 years or so.","Brooklyn, NY","Teachers who love to teach rather than have us memorize are my favorite. That 's why in high school, I really enjoyed my foreign language class teachers, in particular, Mr. Badue, my Spanish literature teacher. These classes were conversational and through gaining experience in speaking a language, we had fun at the same time.Also, what had really gotten me into the field of science was a summer internship offered by the NY Academy of Sciences where I was matched to a lab in the Department of Pathology at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. There, Dr. Sunny Luke took me under his wing and motivated me to pursue science. This was my defining experience as I spent three summers with this program, and was actually able to publish findings from the work I did with the program on studying genetic abnormalities in patients with ovarian cancer. It is uncommon for a high school student to publish a research paper, so I was really fortunate to have this opportunity.","When I was going up, I really enjoyed music. I played piano and many other instruments. Unfortunately, my family 's financial situation did not allow me to pursue music lessons. So, I took an opportunity to tutor a junior high school student. This helped me earn enough money to get me those music lessons!","I am ambidextrous, meaning I can write with both my right hand and my left hand. When I was in school, I had a habit of taking notes with one hand, while highlighting with the other!","Actually, I do not wear make-up so much. I prefer a natural look, finding a happy medium! And I don 't carry a purse because I don 't find it large enough to hold everything I need: my laptop, wallet, etc.  So instead I carry a book bag.","I read mostly scientific books. But the last non-science book that I read was Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg. I feel this book is very useful for women. I am the only female faculty in my department, so I found some great motivating tips in the book, like jumping in and not being shy.","I like Facebook and reading news, such as CNN.  Occasionally, I like to pamper myself with a relaxing massage.","A not for profit organization that I started with my mentor, Dr. Sunny Luke, called the International Institute for Scientific and Academic Collaboration, Inc.

With one operation, I get to change their lives.  Helping people find meaning through organ donation is also very rewarding- we can offer comfort so that even in death your loved one can still help someone else!  It's a big job, there's a lot to it, and you do have to make choices.  Even if I could make different choices, I would still make the same choices- because it is always worth it.  Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.  It's rare and wonderful to be able to offer respite from misery to people, and I love that.","One of the things I struggle with all the time is balance.  Where do I want to be in 25 years?  I'm very dedicated to my family and kids, and I constantly want to make sure that I can be there for my family!  I worry that it might be easier for my kids if I could be at home all the time but I work because I love what I do.  The balance between personal and professional and the expectations I have for myself and the people around me.  I hate to feel like I am letting anyone down.","There's always new discoveries and new medications that come on board that help transplants last longer, medications with fewer side effects.

It's nice to have a mixture of teaching, research and patient care!","I love interacting with patients and getting to know them personally and figuring out what makes them tick!  I love being part of such an effective team- patients get really good care and we have everyone from a pharmacist, dietician, PT and social worker working together.  I have only been at Stanford two years- My husband and I were recruited to build and test out this model of a clinic for a high cost high risk population.",For 28 years I was a family practitioner in a small town in Northern California- running a business and giving good care is a challenge.  For the last 18 years I was also the county health officer and that's challenging because of the responsibility of the population's health and then the politics involved.  Leaving all that and joining Stanford was a huge challenge.  _My husband and I have two children and now we have a beautiful granddaughter- we were fortunate to split one job for ten years so there was always someone at home.

In this capacity she was responsible for advancing HHS priorities, including the Affordable Care Act, within a six state region.  Before joining HHS she was Executive Director of the Ohio Executive Medicaid Management Administration, where she provided strategic direction and led business process improvement projects across six state agencies responsible for health care, aging, public health, behavioral health and developmental disability systems.

Pat Quinn manage the State of Illinois.  That can mean many different things over the course of a day- there are many different work projects that I participate in.  My work,  in terms of my responsibilities fall into 3 buckets- 1) the actual policy work requires implementing Governor Quinn 's policy agenda, working with senior staff, working with members of cabinet, and the things the governor cares about- retaining jobs, improving healthcare access and better education; 2).  the second bucket is outreach- speaking to groups and reaching out to the media so people know what we are doing; and 3).  the third bucket is interacting with different legislators and making legislative decisions and to help them understand how their budgetary decisions play out operationally.","I love several things about my job- it's really interesting because when i first started out in scienceèà.I was passionate about wanting to know how things work and had a thirst for knowledge.  Making the jump into government is actually similar- i like to get to know how things work from a system point of a view- policy wise.  But I 'd say what I love most is the opportunity to make a å¡ö_differentå¡å± difference, improve people 's lives and be in a position to be constantly learning and challenged.  That is  what makes me jump out of  bed in the morning.","in my career, and I think this is very translatable, I deal with important, big and complex issues.  We are dealing with things that impact people's lives directly.  it's very daunting to operate in an environment of imperfect information- it's scary to jump out there and start on a path with the understanding that you have to figure it out as you go.  My science background helps me with this- you are trained to figure out a hypothesis and test it- and if it doesn't work, you adjust and it takes you in a different direction.  The process of making and understanding policy is very similar.  The difference for me in a government context is that you are dealing with a more unforgiving environment- everyone expects you to know, and they don't see a value proposition in the learning process.","I work in the area of translation- the impact side of intersection , where science meets policy. I live and see most things!.  The best example is in health care policy.  Advances in  medical technology- such as: what is the best most effective delivery system to get a drug to a person?  The advances in genetics that can lead to personalized medicine....we don't know what that will mean for cost, but the ability to personalize a treatment plan could have huge positive impacts.

It's a pretty small town on the Ohio River across from Kentucky.",,"The challenge I had was when I made the switch from working in science to working in policy.  In science you do tend to work in teams and collaborate and it is very clear-cut.  Policy is a bit messier- to say the least-  and that background is so helpful to approach problems in a logical and systematic way.  What I found was a strong backlash against my version of collaboration- you have to compromise to collaborate, which you don't in science.  When I first started working in state government, I felt very frustrated because things weren't working as quickly as I wanted.  I figured out how that needed to change and how to work more in teams and accept and recognize in policy the process of compromise is necessary and can be beneficial.

Dr. Ericsson has also worked at NASA HQs as a Program Executive for the Earth Science Enterprise and a Resource Manager Space Science Enterprise. During the last 10 years, she has been an Instrument Manager (IM) in the GSFC Instrument Management and Systems Office. In this capacity, she has led/managed teams of scientist and engineers on various instrument proposals and flight missions. Her proposal efforts include: the Manager for the Space Science Small Explorer Advanced X-Ray Polarimeter (AXP) mission, which was awarded an unsolicited $0.5M to further develop its new technology; Telescope Manager for the Jupiter Magnetosphere Explorer; and, IM for the Vector ElectroDynamics Investigation, Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph Spectrometer instrument (which won a $0.25M), and for Dust Collector Experiment on SCIM, a proposed Mars Scout sample and return mission. Additionally, Dr. Ericsson was the IM for NIRSpec Detector on the James Webb Space Telescope (a follow on mission to the Hubble Space Telescope) and the MMS SMART Fast Plasma Instrument suite. Un-characteristically of an engineer, Dr. Ericsson spent 5 months on detail as a Loaned Executive to the Combine Federal Campaign; there she was responsible for raising ~$2M from federal workers for charities across the Nation.

When I am providing genetic counseling for one of our study participants and I can see it making a positive change for them in some way, perhaps it is making them feel less guilty about their illness or removing the stigma associated with their illness, that 's hugely rewarding for me and will never get tiring. Writing grant applications and academic papers is a hugely creative process, and that 's something I can actually lose hours in, enjoying the process of intellectual creativity. I also love interacting with my students and mentees. I have an amazing group of young women around me who are just full of the most incredible potential and I love helping them find their strengths and to grow in confidence and competence.","I actually never wanted to be a professor. My PhD was all about identifying genetic variations that make a person more vulnerable to developing psychiatric illnesses, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. It was all very interesting research to me, but it was during my PhD that I learned that it wasn 't personally satisfying to me. I didn 't want to make a small contribution to a big change, which is the nature of basic science is all about. Essentially, I wanted to make a big change on a small scale. I wanted to witness the changes I was making; I wanted to be on the people end of things. PhD studies make you incredibly focused and have a deep knowledge, but I found that I didn 't have the communication skills to describe how my research would be meaningful for people who had the disorders I was studying. So, that is what motivated me to train as a genetic counselor. When I finished my genetic counselling MSc training, I did not get the most receptive response trying to get hired as a psychiatric genetic counselor since not a lot of people were doing this very specific line of work. Also, there was a lot of scepticism about whether people with psychiatric illnesses wanted genetic counseling, and about the fact that there was little evidence that genetic counseling would be helpful for people with psychiatric illnesses. So I had to take a step back. I realized I had to do the research to find out whether people wanted genetic counseling or not, and if they did, was there anything positive that could come out this kind of interaction with a healthcare provider. Basically, that 's how I ended up becoming a professor - through doing that research! I had an amazing mentor who was a psychiatrist who had never heard of genetic counseling before meeting me, but he saw the value in my work. He mentored me to write compelling grants, how to articulate my ideas clearly. Ultimately, I was able to win money from funding agencies to answer the sorts of research questions that I found interesting, and to generate evidence supporting the positive effects of genetic counseling for people with psychiatric illness. Through that process I ended up getting tenure as a professor and a prestigious national award a Canada research chair. This allowed me to create the specialist psychiatric genetic counsellor job that I had originally wanted when I graduated as a genetic counsellor -its just that I did not fill this job myself, instead, I hired a brilliant counselor to do it. I feel things have all worked out very well for me in the end - because I have found that I love my job as a professor. The fear and challenge for me was confronting the idea of going back to a research role when at the time, after I had just graduated as a genetic counsellor, I wanted to be talking to people, I wanted to be in a service delivery role. I thought I didn 't have it in me to withstand the competitive academic environment. I didn 't think I was that clever or could survive in that culture. It scared me! In the first three years in my appointment as an assistant professor, I hated it. It was really hard. I did experience sexism. I experienced all sorts of unpleasant things, but what kept me going was my belief in what I was trying to do and help people. I continue to wrestle with ""imposter syndrome "" that people will find out that I 'm actually not that clever, but that feeling becomes less and less over time. I remember when I was awarded the Canada research chair, I literally thought they made a mistake. Then when I realized it was in fact, intended for me, the pressure I felt to deliver was terrifying.","I think there 's always interesting things going on in the basic science fields, like finding genetic variations that contribute to all sorts of diseases. There 's interesting work starting to come out that suggests we can modify our vulnerability to certain kinds of diseases. However, what I am most interested in is communicating with people who have illnesses about what basic science is finding about the causes of their conditions. I am very much interested in the people side of science. I want to take what basic hardcore, genetic, molecular scientists are finding in the lab and make that significant and meaningful for people that live with the conditions that are being researched. What gets me most fired up is about communication processes and how best to engage people. For example, one of the things we were very hopeful about with the human genome project, was how it would change our ability to treat and cure diseases. Now it is about 14 years since we had the first draft of the human genome and its impact on treating and curing diseases is limited. But, we have all of this knowledge about genetic variations that can contribute to the development of diseases, and I am interested in what we can do with that outside of curing disease, I am interested in figuring out how we best use what we know about the genetics of conditions together with counselling and communication skills to invoke behavior change in people. That 's really what genetic counseling is all about _ it 's not just about providing information, but providing information in a supportive and counseling based interaction.","I was born in London (in the UK), but I did not grow up there. When I was about 8, my family moved to a seaside town in Wales called Swansea and I lived there until I was 18 when I moved to go away to university. Swansea is a beautiful place with green spaces and hills, but the implicit message I got at school was ""don 't make too much of yourself "" I felt that this was a particularly strong message if you were female. Many of the girls in my high school class had babies very young, even before we left high school, and did not go on to university. I did not feel that I was supported in fulfilling my potential.","Mrs. Moody, my high school math teacher, who was one of the few female math teachers that we had. She was my favourite because she made me feel like I could do it. In high school in the UK, you specialize in three subjects when you are 15. I decided to do chemistry, and biology but I didn 't really know what to do for the third subject, so essentially because of Mrs. Moody I did math. She had confidence that I could do it and didn 't treat girls with lower expectations, which is how I felt we were treated in other classes. She was actually quite inspirational to me. She spent time with us after class doing things like helping us to overcome our fears about doing math at a higher level.",,"I have been a cave diver for the last ten years. That 's essentially scuba diving in water filled caves. The caves I dive in are filled with fresh water and it is absolutely crystal clear. Because you are weightless, it feels like you are flying!",,"Where to start?! I have loads of favorite books. I love John Steinbeck, especially The Grapes of Wrath and I have read that three or four times. I also like Old Man in the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. Currently, I am reading ""Lean In, "" by Sheryl Sandberg, which I have purchased for everyone on my team! I am totally geeking out on behavioral economics and everything about human decision making and how we think about things. The Invisible Gorilla, Nudge, Thinking Fast and Slow are all books I have recently read and loved.","Well, its not really something I feel guilty about, but its something I am really enjoying right now, it is a twitter feed called the ""good men project. "" It 's like feminism for dudes. It is really cool and they talk about social pressures and expectations that are placed on men. It is very interesting because I have only had woman experiences, so it is interesting to think about other perspectives. There are really intelligent pieces posted on there that are really relevant to everyone - men and women.","I am inspired by the people around me.  I am inspired by watching my mentees grow and watching them get excited about the possibilities for what amazing things they will do next. I find the people with psychiatric disorders that I interact with in my clinic and in our research studies incredibly inspiring, they all seem incredibly brave especially given their willingness to share their experiences. I have had phenomenal mentors in my life who were truly altruistic in their wanting to help me grow for the sake of what I might be able to accomplish, not because of what it could do for them - and they continue to inspire me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lisacooney,"Dr. Lisa Cooney is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, certified Access Consciousness Facilitator, and Master Theta Healer, she has supported thousands of people over the past 20 years in overcoming their childhood sexual abuse to create meaningful and joyful lives. Dr. Lisa is no stranger to childhood sexual abuse.

I am typically working on at least two different projects within the laboratory.  A lot of what I do is computational so I'm at the computer often. I also teach Genome Sciences as well as Contemporary Genetics. I typically teach one class a semester.  I have my graduate degree, my PhD, in genome sciences. All of the research projects in my lab are around genetics and genomics.","I love genetics and genomics and science in general because I am able to experiment with  a lot of different questions and try to answer them. For me, doing research is really exciting. I love it because I'm always exploring new ideas and reading new things. I'm often reading journal articles and popular science articles to try and inform my own research on the latest and most interesting research.","There have definitely been many challenging moments in my career. I actually started in college as a mathematics major. I loved mathematics through elementary school, high school, all throughout. I loved math all through my upbringing and then I reached a point where I thought maybe this isn't the right thing for me to do. That was a big challenge. Those debates on what classes to take, what steps to take, what track to take, were definitely a challenge but also very exciting.","One of the latest innovations that is particularly close to me is the discovery of the thousand dollar genome. This is something that when I started graduate school, a number of years ago, never even existed; it was almost science-fiction.  Now we can genetically sequence the human genome with $1000 and that cost will go down in the next few years . This innovation really opens doors for the way we can look at human genetic data as well as other species. The fact that we can sequence the human genome gives us hope to sequence other species at low-cost to gain insight into biological processes. What's really exciting is the ability to sequence ancient genomes. Research on ancient genomes has been seen in many different articles.  There was one earlier last week about the frequency of different ancient genomes. It's really transforming the way we think about genetics and DNAå¡ã¢It's amazing!  One of my big projects for the PhD was looking at a specific thing that exists in tooth enamel formation. I 've spent a lot of time sequencing this gene and spent a lot of time in the lab.  Now this project can be done in less than a week. This proves how rapidly science technology is improving. All of these ideas are really revolutionizing genomics.","I grew up in Santa Cruz, California. It was wonderful. I currently live in Pullman, Washington and it's snowing outside right now. Living in sunny California and going to high school 10 minutes from the beach was great.  The community in Santa Cruz is incredibly supportive and fun-loving and we were always outside.  I think that really improved my love of science, biology, and mathå¡ã¢just the exposure playing in the woods, in the dirt, and constantly exploring.","One teacher that really influenced me in high school was actually the leadership teacher who also taught a leadership class. She really supported my leadership development and my ability to be involved in high school. This class didn 't relate directly to science, it focused on my development as a leader, learning skills, and how to keep myself and  people organized. This definitely put me at an advantage even though it was a small scale thing. This was an opportunity for me to start as a leader and make small changes. Also when I was a graduate student there was a professor on my PhD committee who supported me. Her influence on my career has been incredible. She has been incredibly supportive and helped me maintain awareness of opportunities and how to take advantage of them.  She has also provided help regarding my research and pointing me towards people with similar interests. To this day she influences and supports my research. I feel very fortunate to have her as a supporter and a mentor.","It's been very interesting adapting and learning the ways to run my own lab. This is very different than being a part of somebody else's research program, which had been my previous experience to this point. It's become apparent to me that [running a lab] it's kind of like running a small business. You have to learn how to manage money, and manage people, hire people, and train people while at the same time conducting research. It's not a specific interest where I need to change my approach but really just learning a whole new skill set for the job. It has been exciting, challenging, and interesting.","One of my unique attributes is my enthusiasm. I am very excited about what I do, and it becomes very clear to anyone who works with me, which has lead to a lot of great collaborations and exciting discussions about science. My hope is that this enthusiasm becomes contagious. ",,"My all time favorite book is called Rain of Gold by Victor Villasenor. It 's a novel that 's written about his parents and their immigration from Mexico to the US. It is a really beautiful novel about these two families and their challenges with coming across the border. Both of them, I believe, are undocumented and building their lives in the US.  Villasenor wonderfully illustrates how they meet, and how their lives become intertwined. I read it in middle school originally and I 've read it multiple times since then; I highly recommend it.","For work, one of my favorite websites is twitter. Many people do not think about Twitter as a good resources for work but the scientific community that I am involved in has some pretty active posters and they 're constantly contributing ideas, thoughts, and posting about new papers.

There are two lessons from this book that I carry with me each day. One is that I have the ability to choose how I want to respond to any situation. Between any stimulus and how I respond to it, I have a choice.  So often in life, we react. We allow our primitive responses to take over, like anger or frustration.  We don 't take the opportunity to choose how we should respond.  In between a stimulus and my response, resides a space of choice.  I leverage that now more than ever. The second lesson I cherish is instead of asking, å¡ö_Why meå¡å± when something happens, I now ask, å¡ö_What is life asking of me in this situation.å¡å±  This shift in thinking prevents me from dwelling too long in personal sorrow and, instead, helps me to rise above my circumstance and be a better person because of it.","My guilty pleasure is good game of Scrabble!
